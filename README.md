ChatAway is a web application where users can send text messages and photos to friends. Users can change the theme of the application and upload their own profile picture. Users can login with their Google account or create an account. The front end was built with React.js and the back end was developed using Node.js and Express.js. The application uses Socket.io for real-time communication and MongoDB for data storage. DaisyUi and Tailwind CSS were used to style the application. I have launched the app [here](https://chataway-refs.onrender.com/login). 

The application is still in progress
